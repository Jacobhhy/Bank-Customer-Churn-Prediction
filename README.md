# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project involves developing algorithms to predict the probability of customer churn for a bank. The models are developed in Python and utilize various supervised machine learning algorithms. The project was conducted over two months, from April to May 2022.

## Project Highlights

Development of predictive models for customer churn probability for a bank using Python.
Preprocessing of a dataset containing 10,000 records, which included categorical feature transformation and standardization.
Training of supervised machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Application of L2 regularization with optimal parameters to prevent model overfitting.
Evaluation of model performance using techniques such as k-fold cross-validation, confusion matrix, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and Area Under the Curve (AUC).
